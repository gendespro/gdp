General Design Project 

GDP 
• creates things, spaces, messages 
• offers guidance 

GDP is an ever expanding horde of concerned individuals intent on improving the way things work and the way things happen. On board is a network engineer, a product designer, a scenographer, some graphic designers, two architects, a local printery, a cabinet maker, a joiner, a steel fabricator, some web developers and curious onlookers trying to judge when to step in to get involved. 

GDP will work with its clients / applicants to understand and develop a message / product / service. GDP wants to get involved in projects that require traditional or up-to-date expertise in designing a product or an interaction between an existing product and a new user group or creating awareness about a product or service through digital or print media. 

=============================

Definitions: 

general: affecting or concerning all or most people, places, or things; not specialised or limited in range of subject, application, activity, etc 

design: purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an action, fact, or material object 

project: an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned and designed to achieve a particular aim


Bad design or the lack of proper design affects users, designers, products and communities, then in turn, society in general and the planet. GDP aims to be as broad as possible. Three main areas: things: products places: architecture messages: graphics 

GDP’s design work feeds from people involved in art, politics, philosophy, science but most of all from users of products. GDP comprises of designers, thinkers, and makers working on open-ended and open source projects together with users, uninterruptedly making improvements to projects which are designed not to be abandoned ever, even after completion. In fact, completion of a design is nothing but the new phase into which it enters. Another vital part of the design work begins at this point.

=============================

Design Academy
A place for continual learning for people interested in the design process: professional / graduate designers, enthusiasts, users of design products (things, places, messages), thinkers, artists, scientists, teachers, analysts (behavioural, urban, anthropological, political, environmental), investors, agents of local and central government, etc. This list is open to expansion as far as the accommodation and quality of learning / exchange is of the highest possible quality. 

Biproducts of Learning
Six chosen designers complete an academic year with GDP at the end of which they all take lifelong responsibility and ownership of a sustainably and ethically manufactured design of a product / service, from which GDP receives equity to sustain its activities. GDP provides the expertise, the funding and the tools necessary to launch the product / service into the market place.

Local Involvement
GDP will build its building, produce its electricity, provide food and light entertainment for those who frequent the premises, involving as much expertise, interest, labour and love as there is locally. GDP has an ‘open door policy’ for members of the public in matters of its development and workings, being mindful of health and safety, and conversely GDP academics will be asked to spend a certain proportion of their time to provide solutions for issues raised by locals and/or follow Papanek’s advice.
